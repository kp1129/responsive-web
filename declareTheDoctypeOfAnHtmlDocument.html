<!--
At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, where the "..." part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Heading Goes Here</h1>
</html>
